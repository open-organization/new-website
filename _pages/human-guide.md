[![Human at a Distance](/assets/images/books/human_distance_cover.png#book-cover)](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/raw/master/books/open_org_guide_distributed_teamwork_1_0.pdf)

This book explores how open principles and practices can help organizations foster collaboration, increase transparency, enhance accountability, and establish a greater degree of trust while their members are geographically separated. It offers distributed teams (those working remotely for the first time, as well as those with extensive remote-work experience) a guide to building dynamic and inclusive organizationsâ€”no matter where their members happen to be.
